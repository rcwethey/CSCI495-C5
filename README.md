# CSCI495-C5

## Description / Purpose
This project is the first of wht could be many JS application that I make in the future. I have create a rendition of the pig game(the dice game). It is currently played on one device, but by 2 people. The purpose of this was to confirm with myself really that I can do more than just HTML and CSS (SASS). I needed to know that I could relly impliment my knowledge and more something with function instead of jut looking nce. 

## Dependencies
No Dependencies!

## Usage
Used HTML, CSS, and JS (for the first time in my life).

## Future Work
For future work, I could incorporate this into a larger site as a game if i were to create a site with mini games on it. Or maybe even a app that could allow multiple people to play this game from different devices in real time.

## What is your major and how this project is related to your major.
Once again, my major is IS and when i graduate I want to go into Web Development. This is essentially my first JS application so it took me a lot longer than it would most people already well versed in JavaScript or Vue.js, React, or Node.js. I beleive with the more I familiarize myself with this language the more I will be able to dive deep into those other frameworks.
